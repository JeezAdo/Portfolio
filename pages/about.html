      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <h3>My Story</h3>
      <p>
        Born and raised in Slovakia, I’ve always been drawn to creative expression and technology. My journey began with
        a love for photography, leading me to explore the streets and capture stories through my lens. Over time, this
        passion evolved into filmmaking, combining visual storytelling with dynamic narratives.
      </p>
      <p>
        Moving to the Netherlands to pursue my studies in Creative Business has been a transformative experience. It’s
        allowed me to refine my skills in filmmaking and marketing while broadening my perspectives as a traveler and
        storyteller. Whether behind the camera or in front of a computer editing, I strive to create meaningful content
        that connects with people and inspires them.
      </p>
      <p>
        Beyond work, I find joy in exploring new places, meeting interesting individuals, and capturing moments that
        tell untold stories. My ultimate goal is to blend creativity with professionalism, working with iconic brands
        like Porsche to create visuals that resonate deeply with audiences.
